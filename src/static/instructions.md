Pronounced Vee-Ar-tEEst. VARTISTE is a virtual reality app for 2D drawing and
image editing, and 3D model texturing. A virtual reality headset with tracked
motion controllers, such as the [Valve
Index](https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex) or [HP Reverb G2](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/vr/reverb-g2-vr-headset.html) is required to use it.

VARTISTE works similar to desktop image editing software you may be used to; it
has layers, brushes, color wheels and palettes. However, it's specially designed
for VR headset use, so it will respond to controller pressure and position, and
you can move your canvas around to get the perfect vantage point for editing.
No more being tethered to a monitor or drawing tablet! It's even got a really
cool node & FX compositing system available. Become a VR-Art√≠ste today!

VARTISTE also takes advantage of being a VR image editor, by allowing you to
draw textures right onto your model! You can still use all of the features like
layers and brushes, and you can even draw onto the material properties like
roughness and bump map!

## Saving and loading

To download your project as a VARTISTE project file, click the "File"
![File](../assets/floppy.png) icon on the settings shelf. You might need to take
your headset off to click the "download" button on your browser. You can also
save the file to your browser's memory by clicking the "Save to Browser" ![File
With Glob](../assets/save-to-browser.png) icon. **Please Note:** clearing
certain browser history data may remove VARTISTE projects from browser memory.

To load a VARTISTE file, drag and drop it onto the browser window where VARTISTE
is running. **NOTE: This will replace your currently active scene.** You can
also use the "Load" ![Folder](../assets/folder-open-outline.png) icon to load
projects from browser memory or browse using a file selector.

To save a PNG, click the "Camera" ![Camera](../assets/camera.png) icon. You'll
need to take off your VR headset and click the download button from your
browser.

To import an image as a new layer, drag and drop it onto the browser window.

To import a 3D model, drag and drop it onto the browser window. The model should
appear in front, and the 2D canvas view will flip to behind you.
**Note the following:**
 - Formats supported:
    - `.glb` is the primary file format supported and will work the best
    - Autoconverted GLTF `.zip` files from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com)
    - Other formats (at least partial support): `.obj`, `.fbx`
 - Existing textures will be resized to the main canvas size

To export a 3D model, use the "Export" ![Cube Arrow](../assets/cube-send.png)
icon. This will download a GLB file with the currently displayed model or
canvas. You can also export directly to [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com) using
the "Sketchfab" ![Sketchfab Logo](../assets/sketchfab.png) icon. The first time
you click this icon, you'll be prompted to log into Sketchfab and authorize
VARTISTE, so make sure you save before you do this.

**NOTE:** Canvas Animations are not currently imported or exported to GLB files.
They are, however, saved into the project file.

## Node Compositing System

By default, VARTISTE operates in Layer mode, where layers can be ordered one on
top of the other, similar in operation to the GIMP or Photoshop. VARTISTE also
has another mode of operation, called Node mode. VARTISTE can be toggled between
Layer and Node mode by pressing the "Toggle" ![Light
Switch](../assets/light-switch.png) button on the Layer / Node control panel.

Node mode works in a roughly similar way to the Blender compositing nodes, for
instance. Outputs from Layers and nodes are connected to Node inputs, allowing
dynamically updating effects. Node connections are formed by grabbing an output
node connector, and dragging it to an input node connector

## Multiplayer Drawing (Multidraw)

In order to use multiplayer in VARTISTE, you must enable the Node Compositing
System.

Creating a Multidraw Broadcast node ![New Multidraw Broadcast
Node](../assets/cube-send.png) will allow you to share your drawing live with
others. Whatever is connected to the input of the Broadcast Node will be
broadcast over the internet. Whoever knows the name that is set on the node (you
can leave this to the randomly generated name or set your own) can create a
Multidraw Receiver Node to connect and incorporate your drawing into theirs.

Creating a Multidraw Receiver Node will allow you to receive a live drawing over
the internet. You can connect the Receiver Node output to an input in order to
incorporate it into your drawing.

You can use both Broadcast and Receive nodes in your composition in order to
build a collaborative drawing experience. Click the Copy Connection Link to
Clipboard ![Web Icon](../assets/web.png) to copy a link which you can share;
whoever access the links will autoconnect to your multidraw nodes.

Please note that Broadcast names are handled on a first-come-first-serve basis
via [PeerServer Cloud](https://peerjs.com/peerserver.html). There is no
guarantee that you will be able to use the name you enter, nor that you will be
able to use the same name again after you close the page. See [the Privacy
Policy](#privacy) for further disclaimers.

Use this link to quickly get started with pre-connected, randomly generated
Broadcast and Receiver nodes: [`https://vartiste.xyz/?broadcastTo=random&receiveFrom=random`](/?broadcastTo=random&receiveFrom=random)

## Animation System

The animation system is controlled by the Animation shelf. Layers can each have
multiple frames. The animation shelf will show the number of frames for the
active layer, and allow adding, deleting, and duplicating active layer frames.

There is a single timeline and framerate for all frames, and layers will repeat
however many frames they have over and over again. Any drawing will be applied
to the current frame, which can change over the course of the drawing. This
means if the animation is currently playing back, then parts of strokes can be
applied to different frames, giving a kind of animated brush effect.

## Tips And Tricks

- **Tip:** If VARTISTE is slow, unresponsive, or laggy
  - Toggle the UI ![Eye](../assets/eye.png) off from the Settings shelf or the controller.
  - Use the Medium Quality ![Dice 4](../assets/dice-4.png) or Low Quality ![Dice 2](../assets/dice-2.png)
  - Use a smaller canvas size
  - Break up large models into smaller chunks, or use lower-resolution versions.
    As long as everything shares the same UV map, you can import the large model
    at the end to combine it all.
  - Turn off Hand Stabilization ![Hand with Two Lines](../assets/hand-two-lines.png)
  - Try using spray cans or volumetric brushes instead of point-and-click or pencils. They use different underlying mechanisms for drawing, and have different performance characteristics.
  - I've gotten the best performance out of Chrome (You may need to [launch with special flags](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/issues/4558))
    - Works with Chrome canary 86.0.4214.0:
      - SteamVR: `start chrome.exe --disable-features=XRSandbox --enable-features=OpenVR --force-webxr-runtime=OpenVR`
    - [Or you can download a Chromium version with pretested flags](#download)
- **Trick:** To _Copy and Paste_ try this:
  1. Duplicate ![Plus Box Multiple](../assets/plus-box-multiple.png) the layer
  1. Erase the parts of the duplicated layer that you don't want copied
  1. Use the Grab Layer ![Arrow All](../assets/arrow-all.png) button and then
     grab and move the layer where you want it to go
  1. Use the Stamp Down ![Archive Arrow Down](../assets/archive-arrow-down-outline.png)
     button to stamp the layer onto the layer below
  1. Grab and stamp again as many times as desired
- **Tip:** If you're working with a really smooth or metallic model, try adding
  an Environment Map (`envMap`) layer or an HDR environment
  - You can find HDR environments at [HDRI Haven](https://hdrihaven.com/)
  - You can find images to use for environment maps at [WikiMedia Commons 360¬∞ Panoramas](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:360¬∞_panoramas#mw-category-media)
  - Environment map layers don't need to be the same size as the rest of the
    layers, so you can use higher or lower quality images if helpful.
  - Environment maps only take effect if 3D Shading ![Sun Icon](../assets/brightness-4.png)
    is enabled
- **Trick:** Some brushes, like the default smooth circle brush, will draw
  connected lines as you move your hand around. If you're drawing onto a 3D
  model, and the UV map is discontinuous, this can cause a big line to go
  through to all sorts of areas where you don't expect. Some ways to deal with
  that:
  - Use a brush that doesn't connect lines (most of the textured brushes)
  - Use a different method for unwrapping your model UV map

## Download

You can download VARISTE as well. The download contains a build of Chromium
which has been rebranded with a VARTISTE icon. It also contains the current
version of the VARTISTE application, along with a little launcher which will
launch the bundled Chromium with flags for OpenXR. You can then choose to launch
the exact version that you downloaded, or launch the web version, which will
always be up-to-date.

<a class="launch-button" href="https://gitlab.com/zach-geek/vartiste/-/jobs/artifacts/release/file/chromium/chromium-vartiste.zip?job=chromium">Download VARTISTE for Windows</a>

To run, extract the zip file to a folder, and then run `vartiste-launcher.exe`

**Linux COMING SOON**. But for now, you can install chromium version 86.0.4231.0

## A-Frame VARTISTE Toolkit

VARTISTE is built on top of the wonderful [A-Frame
framework](https://aframe.io). I've compiled many of the components and systems
I've written while building VARTISTE into a separate library that you can use in
your own A-Frame projects. If you want to create a laser-pointer button-heavy
interface like VARTISTE has, it's a great starting point!
